# Introduction

In today’s digital world, data has become an essential part of every organization's decision-making process. E-commerce organizations, in particular, deal with large amounts of data from various sources, such as customer transactions, website interactions, and social media platforms. The analysis of this data can provide valuable insights into consumer behaviour, market trends, and potential growth opportunities. Likewise, the report's goal is to complete the process of extracting, refining, and delivering the Olist dataset, which is a collection of orders placed between 2016 and 2018 on the Olist Store, a Brazilian ecommerce company. Along with this, Marketing Qualified Leads data is provided, which contains information on the MQL requests received by Olist from 2017 to 2018. To explore these datasets, this report employs the reverse engineering of the database and explores data using data management techniques such as SQL DDL, Entity Relationship Diagrams, Normalization, and SQL Queries.  

## Setting up database connection
```{r defineconnection}
my_connection <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),"DM_assignment.db")
```


# A1: Identification of entities, relationships, cardinalities and attributes and any assumptions related to the pre-normalized datasets. 

## Assumptions
We have a few key assumptions regarding these datasets. They are as follows: \
A. Although the relationship between customers and orders appears 1:1 we believe it is actually 1:N, as there is nothing stopping a customer from ordering again. \
B. Every customer is a separate customer even if they belong to the same household. \
C. A zip code should uniquely identify one city, and one state. \
D. We cannot identify a state, with a city name. \

## Identifying keys

To define the primary key for each table, the first column is chosen to check if suitable for being the primary key (Appendix 10.1). After that, 7 out of 11 tables identified the primary key. Only four tables contain duplicate values in each row in the first column, meaning the primary key will consist of two or more columns to be a composite key. Comparing the first column with additional columns using the group by function to get a combination of more than one column that uniquely identifies any record. To create and enforce a connection between the information in two tables, foreign keys were identified as non-primary key columns in one table that were the primary key in a different table. In next section, we have provided a summary of our findings. 


```{r ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, include=FALSE,attr.source='.numberLines'}

input_files <- list.files(pattern="*.csv")

prefix <- "olist_"
suffix1 <- "_dataset.csv"
suffix2 <- ".csv"

table_name_list <- list() 

df_keys <- setNames(data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0)), 
                    c("file_name", "col_name", "num_unique",
                      "total_rows"))

df_info <-  setNames(data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0)), 
                     c("file_name", "number_columns",
                       "number_rows","first_col_primary_key"))


for (file_name in input_files) {
  this_file_contents <- readr::read_csv(file_name)
  #ensure no duplicates
  this_file_contents <- distinct(this_file_contents)
  number_of_rows <- nrow(this_file_contents)
  number_of_columns <- ncol(this_file_contents)


  df_info[nrow(df_info)+1, 1] <- file_name
  df_info[nrow(df_info), 2] <- number_of_columns
  df_info[nrow(df_info), 3] <- number_of_rows
  df_info[nrow(df_info), 4] <- nrow(unique(this_file_contents[,1]))==number_of_rows

    for (i in 1:ncol(this_file_contents)){
        df_keys[nrow(df_keys) + 1,1] <- file_name
        df_keys[nrow(df_keys),2] <- colnames(this_file_contents[,i])
    df_keys[nrow(df_keys), 3] <- nrow(unique(this_file_contents[,i]))
    df_keys[nrow(df_keys), 4] <- nrow(this_file_contents)

    }

# A4: Identification of problems with the data records including empty values, issues with columns and duplicates.

### Empty values & Duplicates

```{r ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
df_issues <- setNames(data.frame(matrix(ncol = 3, nrow = 0)), 
                      c("file_name", "NA_count", "duplicates_count"))

for (file_name in input_files) {
  this_file_contents <- readr::read_csv(file_name)
  #ensure no duplicates
  df_issues[nrow(df_issues)+1, 1] <- file_name
  df_issues[nrow(df_issues), 2] <- sum(is.na(this_file_contents))
  df_issues[nrow(df_issues), 3] <- sum(duplicated(this_file_contents))
  }
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(df_issues, format = "latex", row.names = FALSE, 
      caption= "A4", format.args = list(big.mark = ","), digits = 2)%>%
  kable_styling(position = "left",
      latex_options = c("repeat_header", "HOLD_position"))
```
The NA values were identified in 5 data sets, namely marketing qualified leads, closed deals, products, orders, and order reviews, while  punctuations like a dot or comma are spotted from the order reviews data sets instead of empty values.
Additionally, duplicates are not identified in the datasets except geolocation. 

### Issues with columns

```{r ,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
geolocation_df <- RSQLite::dbGetQuery(my_connection,
"SELECT * FROM geolocation; ")
sellers_df <- RSQLite::dbGetQuery(my_connection,
"SELECT * FROM sellers")
customer_df <- RSQLite::dbGetQuery(my_connection,
"SELECT *FROM customers; ")
df_example <- head(distinct(geolocation_df, geolocation_city),10)
```

```{r}
print(paste0("Geolocation has ", 
             sum(grepl('[^[:punct:]]', geolocation_df$geolocation_city))
             , " punction characters in the city column"))
```

```{r}
print(paste0("Sellers has ",
             sum(grepl('[^[:punct:]]', sellers_df$seller_city))
             , " punction characters in the city column"))
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(df_example, format = "latex",row.names = FALSE, 
      caption= "A4 - Issues with City name examples", 
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","), digits = 2)%>%
  kable_styling(position = "center",
      latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

In the geolocation dataset, we found inconsistency with city name such as sao paulo and são paulo. The same issue is detected in sellers dataset, where some entries contain both city name and state (e.g., ‘lages – sc’), or more than 1 city name (e.g., santo andre/ sao paulo). We also found 2 error values in sellers dataset (e.g., 04482255). 
In order to address these issues, data cleaning is performed before normalisation, where empty values are imputed or dropped and duplicates are removed from the database. Further, the 'zip code' column contains leading zeros, which must be stored as a string to preserve the leading zeros. The codes are represented in Appendix 10.2



\newpage

# A5 Normalize the database to the highest order normal form. 
The codes for normalisation of the database is available in Appendix 10.3
## Closed_deals

### Normalisation to 1NF:  

**Problem:** lead_behaviour_profile has multiple values in a particular cell. 

**Solution:** Split it and make each cell contain a single value and set the composite key to {mql_id, lead_behaviour_profile}. 

 

### Normalisation to 2NF:  

**Problem:** The other attributes partially depend on the composite primary key. 

**Solution:** lead_behaviour_profile is separated into a different table with mql_id to avoid partial dependency.  

 

### Normalisation to 3NF:  

**Problem:** Information regarding the seller’s business has a transitive dependency on the seller_id, not the mql_id. 

**Solution:** Divide closed deals into two tables, closed_deals_seller_info and closed_deals, to separate the business information regarding the seller and the deal information. 

## Order_reviews

### Normalisation to 1NF:  

**Solution:** Set to a composite key of {review_id, order_id}. No multiple values exist in a particular cell, so it is already 1NF. 

 

### Normalisation to 2NF:  

**Problem:** The review details depended only on the review_id, not the composite key of {review_id, order_id}.  

**Solution:** Split order_reviews into olist_order_reviews and review_orders to avoid partial dependency. 

 

### Normalisation to 3NF:   

**Solution:** No transitive dependencies exist, and therefore 3NF has been reached. 

 


## Orders

### Normalisation to 1NF:  

**Solution:** Set the primary key as {order_id}. No multiple values exist in a particular cell, so it is already 1NF. 

 

### Normalisation to 2NF:  

**Solution:** As there is no partial reliance, 2NF has been attained. 

 

### Normalisation to 3NF:  

**Problem:** Transitive dependence exists since a customer is assumed to be able to place multiple orders. {customer_id, order_delivered_carrier_date} -> {order_delivered_customer_date} 

**Solution:** Split orders into two tables, orders and order_delivery. This was to separate delivery information from order information. 



## Customers, sellers and geolocation 

### Normalisation to 1NF:  

**Solution:** setting the primary key to {customer_id}, {seller_id}, and composite key to {geolocation_lat, geolocation_lng, geolocation_city, geolocation_zip_code_prefix, geolocation_state} respectively. A particular cell has no multiple values, so it is already 1NF. 

 

### Normalisation to 2NF:  

**Solution:** As there is no partial reliance, 2NF has been attained. 

 

### Normalisation to 3NF:  
**Problem:** Using the same information, such as zip code, city, and state, in multiple tables was redundant. Transitive dependence is present between {zip_code} -> {city, state}. 

**Solution:** Create a new table, namely zip_city_state to eliminate redundancy. This table exclusively retained unique combinations of zip code, city, and state while excluding duplicative data. Consequently, the city and state attributes in the customers, sellers, and geolocation tables were removed. Instead, the zip code attribute was utilised as a foreign key to establishing a connection to the zip_city_state table. 



## Other tables

Other tables are not split as they are in the highest normalisation form. 

The most recent normalisation does a better job than the prior one at removing redundant data. Therefore, the data requires less storage space and reduce problems caused by data alteration. Moreover, less distinct and group by is used while looking up data, which speeds up queries. Superfluous attributes no longer constrain data modification, and data can be updated more quickly because of the discovery and separation of all partial and transitive dependencies.

## Efficiency of the solution:

We have successfully achieved 3NF by the discovery and separation of all partial and transitive dependencies. Now, there are less anomalies and redundancies in the database. Therefore, if Olist uses our solution they will have the benefit of a lower storage space requirement and a reduction in problems caused by data alteration. Moreover, queries will be more efficient as less distinct and group by statements will be required. However, there is room for further improvements in the products table. Instead of storing the name of the product, we could store a product number, which could link to the product_category_name_translation table, which can lead to a lower data storage space requirement.

## SQL Query 1
This query provides insights into the performance of different business types and segments of sellers, to identify the ones with highest revenue and orders. Total revenue is the sum of price of each product and its associated shipping cost, that a company passes on to its customers. The query uses filter to exclude cancelled or unavailable orders, as they do not generated income to the business. However, it might be useful to include a time period in the query to provide a more granular view of revenue and order trends over time for each business segment. 
```{sql, connection=my_connection, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H'}
CREATE VIEW QUERY1 AS
SELECT
  cd.business_type,
  cd.business_segment,
  SUM(ot.price + ot.freight_value) AS Total_Revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM
  orders o
  LEFT JOIN order_items ot ON ot.order_id = o.order_id
  INNER JOIN closed_deals_seller_info cd ON cd.seller_id = ot.seller_id
WHERE o.order_status NOT IN ('unavailable', 'canceled')
GROUP BY cd.business_type, cd.business_segment
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC

```

## SQL Query 2
This query extracts the total number of closed deals, revenue generated per seller, and the average number of orders per seller. The results provide insights into the performance of sellers in different states. However, some closed deal sellers cannot be linked to any provided state due to data quality issues. Completing the data would result in a more efficient analysis. 
```{sql, connection=my_connection,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

## SQL Query 3
This query extracts the total revenue, average revenue, and total number of orders for each month in 2017 and 2018. The results are grouped by year and month, the revenue is calculated by adding the price and freight value for each order. However, the analysis only includes total revenue data starting from 2018. Therefore, gathering additional data would allow us to better understand trends in SDR's sales performance over time. 
```{sql, connection=my_connection,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
CREATE VIEW QUERY3 AS

  strftime('%Y', DATE(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'unixepoch')) AS Year,
  strftime('%m', DATE(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'unixepoch')) AS Month,
  SUM(ot.price + ot.freight_value) AS Total_Revenue,
  ROUND(AVG(ot.price + ot.freight_value),2) AS Avg_Revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM
  closed_deals cd
  INNER JOIN order_items ot ON cd.seller_id = ot.seller_id
  INNER JOIN orders o ON ot.order_id = o.order_id

## SQL Query 4
The query extracts the total revenue, total orders, and order per seller for each sales department representative (SDR). However, the analysis would be improved if we could identify the meaning behind each sales department representative ID number.

## SQL Query 5
This query extracts the average time it takes to close a deal for each product category, as well as the total number of closed deals for each category. Here the assumption that each seller can sell only one product category is made. However, using the average time to close deals may not be accurate, as some sellers may perform better than others within each product category.

locations_sellers <- distinct(locations_sellers)

locations_sellers %>% group_by(zip_code_prefix) %>%

```

Sellers:
- A lot of mispellings in seller city, some values will not match any value in geolocation table for the purposes of joining. 
- We can attempt to find the closest match in geolocation cities, but this has proven unsuccessful 
- We can leave the data as is or change the incorrect cities to NA (or manually try correct each one)


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Cleaning customers, reviewing NAs, normalising
tbl(my_connection, "customers") %>%
  group_by(customer_city) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(n)

locations_customers <- distinct(locations_customers)

locations_customers %>% group_by(zip_code_prefix) %>% 
  count() %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

Customers:
-Similar situation to sellers table. Lots of the customer cities don't match any in the geolocation table. 
-We can leave the data as is or change the incorrect cities to NA (or manually try correct each one)

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cust_sellers_locs <- rbind(locations_sellers,locations_customers)
#keep distinct combinations
cust_sellers_locs <- distinct(cust_sellers_locs)

cust_sellers_locs %>% group_by(zip_code_prefix) %>% 
  count() %>% arrange(desc(n))
```
